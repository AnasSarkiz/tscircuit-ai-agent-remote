# tscircuit AI agent remote

Revision A0-C5656610-local-hole, updated 2026-10-03: **B-002 acoustic diameter corrected locally; B-003 ground-pad port generation remains blocked; no complete schematic or PCB exists**. Not ready for routing or fabrication; untested prototype intent.

Private repository: https://github.com/AnasSarkiz/tscircuit-ai-agent-remote

The accepted device is the square, screen-dominant concept with one top-edge hold-to-talk button, a speaker and rechargeable battery. Hold, speak and release to send a Wi-Fi request; show and speak the response. All PCB electronics must assemble on the top side. The encoder and separate APPROVE/REJECT controls are removed from the active design. See `REQUIREMENTS.md` for the complete requirement changes and remaining interface decisions. Firmware implementation is outside this task.

The user approved a maximum PCB envelope of **50 x 65 mm**. A **50 x 50 mm square target** starts the mechanical study within that envelope; it is not yet validated. Four copper layers are intended. Accepted visual reference: [square product concept](assets/product-concepts/ai-remote-v1-infographic-v3.png); rendered placement is illustrative.

## Rechargeable battery

One protected **1S, nominal 3.7 V, 4.2 V-charge LiPo pack**, targeting **500–1000 mAh**, USB-C charging and operation while plugged in. BQ24074RGTR / C54313 and TPS63802DLAR / C2845237 remain the charger/power-path and 3.3 V regulator candidates. A top-side SMT battery connector, JST S2B-PH-SM4-TB(LF)(SN) / **C295747**, is now imported verbatim through the supported workflow. Exact pack, harness polarity, thermistor, charge current, protection, runtime and mechanical fit still need qualification. This is requirement/BOM preparation, not an integrated battery circuit.

## Published update check

Installed and pinned **tscircuit 0.0.2736 / CLI 0.1.2232** on 2026-10-03. Fresh C5656610 import still contains the **0.3999992 mm** acoustic opening; TDK recommends at least **0.50 mm**. **B-002 is not fixed in the tested published release.** This is historical recheck evidence; the subsequently authorized local correction is described below. Version metadata, import logs, checksums and diagnostic evidence are saved under `evidence/update-check-2026-10-03/`. Dependent placement/routing remain stopped.

## User-authorized microphone correction

C5656610 / ICS-43434 now uses a **0.60 mm** acoustic hole at the original center.
Every non-diameter byte in the imported file is unchanged. Raw supplier evidence
confirms that the original 0.3999992 mm hole comes from the LCSC-owned footprint;
the converter preserves it correctly. No supplier-library or converter change
was made.

Generated geometry confirms **0.60 mm**, nine unchanged copper pad shapes and
minimum hole-edge-to-copper clearance **0.2580203 mm**. The isolated placement
check passed with zero errors/warnings. Evidence and the original source are
saved in `evidence/microphone-local-correction-2026-10-03/`.

**BLOCKING B-003:** the native renderer rejects pin 3's four separated ground-pad
shapes as an ambiguous port, leaving those shapes with null PCB-port links.
The component build still exits 1, even with the documented `MIC1.pin3` selector.
No geometry, pin mapping or check was changed to hide this failure. This does
not indicate a diagnosed short, and B-002's hole correction remains verified.

## Historical corrected encoder import

**ALPS EC11E15244G1 / LCSC C370970:** the user explicitly authorized correcting this imported component's symbol and footprint. Its five terminal holes are now **1.05 mm**, and its two mounting slots are **2.65 mm long**, within ALPS's 1.00–1.10 mm and 2.60–2.70 mm ranges. **B-001 is resolved locally for the reported dimensions.** The external supplier library has not been changed.

C370970 uses its existing native `<chip>` as a schematic box. Pin labels, centers, slot widths/orientation, outer pads, silkscreen, courtyard and models are unchanged. This encoder is no longer part of the accepted one-button design; its correction and evidence are retained historically. The microphone now also has a diameter-only authorized correction. Other imports remain unmodified. Isolated review artifacts are not the handheld board or fabrication package. No handheld placement, routes or fabrication outputs exist.

## Commands

Run inside this directory. `bun install` installs pinned dependencies. `bun run format:check` and `bun run typecheck` check project tooling. `bun test` passes all five import checks, including the C5656610 acoustic-opening check; historical encoder checks remain as evidence, not active BOM approval. `bun run build` reports that the complete board has not been authored. The original proposal is preserved in `evidence/proposals/C5656610-acoustic-hole.diff`. The latest user instruction authorized applying it locally. B-003 still prevents a clean microphone build and dependent board work.

## Evidence and remaining work

See `VALIDATION.md`, `BOM.md`, `issues.md`, `references/sources.md` and `routes/README.md`. Continue in this task directory. No earlier board source or validation evidence was reused.
